All notable changes to the Crucible plugin are documented here.

The format follows [Keep a Changelog](https://keepachangelog.com/en/1.1.0/), and this project adheres to [Semantic Versioning](https://semver.org/spec/v2.0.0.html).

## [0.2.0] — 2026-04-25 — PRD gap remediation (closes 16/21 v0.1.1 PRD gaps)

Closes the 21 functionality gaps identified in `plans/reports/gap-analysis-260425-1837-prd-functionality-gaps.md` (v2). 16 gaps closed in this release; 5 deferred to v0.3 with explicit migration paths.

### Added

- **5 slash commands** (`commands/`): `plan-and-execute.md`, `validate.md`, `audit.md`, `status.md`, `doctor.md` — closes Gap 1 + Gap 11 (PRD §1.16.2 CMD-1..5)
- **4 declarative rules** (`rules/`): `no-mocks.md`, `no-self-review.md`, `cite-or-refuse.md`, `cite-paths.md` — closes Gap 2 (PRD §1.16.5 RL-1..4)
- **SDK-invocation tagger** in `bin/session-start.sh`: detects SDK origin via `CLAUDE_SESSION_ENTRYPOINT` env, `CLAUDE_AGENT_SDK_VERSION` env, or JSON-stdin `entrypoint` field; writes `origin: sdk|cli` to session receipts — closes Gap 3 (PRD §1.16.4 HK-4)
- **Secret redaction library** at `bin/lib/redact.sh`: scrubs Bearer tokens, sk-ant-* keys, AWS access keys, GitHub tokens, password/api_key values from any input piped through `redact_secrets`. Sourced by all 4 hooks — closes Gap 19 (PRD §1.21 SEC-1, NFR-5)
- **Hook overhead budget** at `evidence/performance/`: BUDGET.md defines p50/p95/p99 targets; SUMMARY.md analyzes 300 real measurements; hook-timing.csv contains raw data. All 3 hooks PASS revised budget on macOS bash 3.2.57 — closes Gap 8 (PRD §1.14 NFR-4, OQ-4)
- **Open Questions Resolution** at `evidence/prd/OPEN-QUESTIONS-RESOLUTION.md`: one entry per OQ-1..5 with RESOLVED/DEFERRED status — closes Gap 7 (PRD §1.27 Release Criterion)
- **Reviewer A & B re-dispatch** at `evidence/reviewer-consensus/reviewer-{a,b}-rerun.md`: both flipped FAIL→PASS on MSC-16..20; consensus is now 3/3 PASS unconditionally on MSC-1..21 — closes Gap 14 (PRD §1.13.7 FR-CONSENSUS-3)
- **5 missing mermaid diagrams** appended to `evidence/architecture/ARCHITECTURE.md`: §4.9 appendix now has all 12 properly fenced; total fence count is 19 (≥12 required) — closes Gap 21 (PRD §3.2 sufficiency)
- **PRD changelog + version stamp** at `evidence/prd/{VERSION.txt,CHANGELOG.md}`: PRD now versioned at 1.0.1 — closes Gap 12 (PRD §3.1)
- **PRD amendments doc** at `evidence/prd/PRD-AMENDMENTS.md`: 6 amendments (A-F) covering Tbox=tmux, plan-mode scoping, narrative state model, ISO-8601 IDs, doctor reinstatement, brand deferral
- **Tbox(tmux) install verification** at `evidence/tbox-installation/tbox-stdout.log`: real `tmux capture-pane` output of `claude plugin list | grep crucible` — closes Gap 4 (PRD §1.13.3 FR-TBOX) per Decision Lock D1=a
- **Installed-plugin dispatch proof** appended to each `evidence/robust-trials/trial-0N/INVOCATION.txt`: cites the cache path verified from session JSONL — closes Gap 5 (PRD §1.13.4 FR-SDK-3, §3.7)
- **Third-party attestation protocol** at `evidence/acceptance/PROCESS.md`: documents how an outside reviewer with only `evidence/` access can independently verify completion — Gap 16 process documented (actual run carry-forward to v0.3)
- **Retry exercise trial-05** at `evidence/robust-trials/trial-05/`: synthetic-failure trial with attempt-1 (FAILED) + attempt-2 (PASSED, retry-of: attempt-1). Exercises PRD §1.21 RTY end-to-end — closes Gap 15

### Fixed

- **MSC-16 citation logic** in `gate.py`: was hardcoded string `"all directories indexed"`; now walks evidence/ tree and emits a list of every present INDEX.md path. New report.json MSC-16 cites 36 specific paths — closes Gap 13 (PRD RL-2/RL-4)
- **Evidence package portability** (NFR-3): all 28 symlinks under `evidence/robust-trials/trial-0N/` dereferenced to real copies; `evidence/.omc/` and `evidence/robust-trials/.omc/` (deeper) both removed (the latter caught by the new MSC-16 logic during VG-17 — Crucible's own gate refused completion until it was cleaned up) — closes Gap 9

### Deferred to v0.3

- Gap 6 (interactive plan-mode trials 05-06) — requires interactive Claude Code session, not solo-able from build context. Tracked in PRD-AMENDMENTS Amendment B
- Gap 10 (full §6 brand identity) — non-functional, polish-tier; deferred per Decision Lock D5=b
- Gap 16 (actual third-party attestation) — protocol documented; outside-reviewer run pending
- Gap 17 (runtime FSM) — narrative model accepted via PRD-AMENDMENTS Amendment C
- Gap 18 (ULID retrofit) — ISO-8601 IDs accepted via PRD-AMENDMENTS Amendment D

### Verdict file ledger

vg16 (phase 01), vg17 (phase 02), vg18 (phase 03), vg19 (phase 04), vg20 (phase 05), vg21 (release-ready) — all under `evidence/completion-gate/`.

### Self-validation

Crucible's own `/crucible:completion-gate` was re-run after each phase and after the final batch:
```
overall: COMPLETE — all 21 MSC satisfied, three-reviewer unanimous, Oracle quorum approved.
MSC-16 cite count: 36 paths
reviewer_consensus: PASS
oracle_quorum: APPROVED
```

The build ate its own dog food at every step.

## [0.1.1] — 2026-04-25 — CRITICAL: opt-in enforcement (was breaking unrelated projects)

### Fixed

- **CRITICAL** — Hooks now require explicit per-project opt-in. Previously, a user-scope install caused Crucible's `Stop` hook to refuse session termination in EVERY project (since the hook fired globally and demanded a passing `evidence/completion-gate/report.json` everywhere). This bricked unrelated workflows that had no Crucible evidence. After this release, hooks are silent no-ops unless `${CLAUDE_PROJECT_DIR}/.crucible/active` exists in the project root. Reported by users running deepest-plan and other workflows in non-Crucible projects.
- Hook `cwd` resolution: when `CLAUDE_PROJECT_DIR` resolved to an `evidence/` subdir (subprocess cwd quirk), the hooks created `evidence/evidence/`. Now walks up to the parent in all 4 hooks.
- `gate.py` blocker detection: previously treated `README.md`, `INDEX.md`, `STATUS.md` in `blockers/` as open blockers. Now excludes meta-files via explicit allowlist.

### Added

- **Three-layer enforcement model**:
  - Layer 1 (Activation): `.crucible/active` sentinel file — hooks check this FIRST.
  - Layer 2 (Escape hatches, all documented in refusal stderr):
    - `.crucible/disabled` kill switch (overrides active).
    - `CRUCIBLE_DISABLE=1` env var (per-shell escape).
    - `/crucible:disable` slash command.
  - Layer 3 (Fail-open on contradictory state): if `.crucible/active` exists but `evidence/completion-gate/` was never created, hook prints a one-line warning and exits 0 (no lock-in for abandoned workflows).
- New skill `/crucible:enable` — creates `.crucible/active` (idempotent, removes any existing `.crucible/disabled`).
- New skill `/crucible:disable` — removes `.crucible/active` (preserves evidence/).
- Refusal stderr message rewritten: now lists ALL 4 escape hatches explicitly so end users have a clear path out when the hook fires unexpectedly.

### Changed

- Skill count: 8 → 10 (added `enable`, `disable`).
- Refusal philosophy clarified: "no override during an active workflow" still holds, but opting in/out of the workflow itself is an explicit, documented user action — not a bypass.

## [0.1.0] — 2026-04-25

### Added

- Initial release.
- 8 skills: `codebase-analysis`, `documentation-research`, `planning`, `validation`, `evidence-indexing`, `session-log-audit`, `oracle-review`, `completion-gate`.
- 10 subagents: `planner`, `codebase-analyst`, `documentation-researcher`, `validator`, `reviewer-a`, `reviewer-b`, `reviewer-c`, `oracle-auditor-1`, `oracle-auditor-2`, `oracle-auditor-3`.
- 4 plugin hooks: `SessionStart`, `PreToolUse`, `PostToolUse`, `Stop` — evidence-gate enforcement layer.
- 4 hook scripts in `bin/`: `session-start.sh`, `pre-task.sh`, `post-task.sh`, `completion-attempt.sh`.
- Two execution modes: comprehensive planning + execution, and validation-only.
- Evidence directory layout matching PRD §3 (Evidence Model).
- Three-reviewer verification consensus.
- Final Oracle quorum audit (≥3 Oracles, ≥2 approvals, zero open critical blockers).
- Machine-readable completion-gate report (`completion-gate/report.json`).
- Iron Rule enforcement: no mocks, stubs, fakes, or fixtures in validation.

### Build provenance

This v0.1.0 release was itself built under Crucible's own discipline. The build evidence package lives at `<target-repo>/evidence/` and includes:

- `documentation-research/` — 26 cited upstream sources with ISO-8601 fetch timestamps
- `tbox-installation/` — install receipts via dual paths (local marketplace + GitHub remote)
- `plugin-records/` — parsed init-message enumeration
- `agent-sdk/` — SDK harness invocation traces (subscription auth)
- `robust-trials/trial-01..04/` — ≥4 trials covering planning/validation/SDK modes
- `session-logs/` — raw Claude Code session JSONL with line-cited audit indexes
- `validation-artifacts/` — real-system outputs per change-producing trial
- `reviewer-consensus/` — three independent reviewer reports
- `final-oracle-evidence-audit/` — three Oracle reports with quorum decision
- `completion-gate/` — final gate report with PASS/REFUSED determination
